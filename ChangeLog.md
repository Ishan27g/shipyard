# Change Log

## version 0.0.32

### Remote Exec
* Ensure remote exec containers use a unique ID

## version 0.0.31

### Containers

Add ability to configure network aliases for containers

```
  network { 
    name = "network.onprem"
    ip_address = "10.5.0.200"
    // Add network aliases for the container
    aliases = ["web.ingress.container.shipyard.run", "api.ingress.container.shipyard.run"]
  }
```

## version 0.0.30

### Bugfixes Exec
* Fix log output when executing commands in containers

## version 0.0.28

## Remote Exec
* Add `working_directory` parameter to allow setting of the execution folder when running commands

## version 0.0.26

### Push Command
* Changes to caching volumes inadvertently changed the behaviour of the `push` command. When an image was already cached in the cluster image volume `push` would 
  not overwrite this image. If the user specifies the `--force-update` command then the pushed image would be overwritten regardles of local cache; however, force-update
  would also attempt to pull the image from a remote registry. Push was designed to push a local image to a cluster as part of the development flow, pulling remote images
  is not desireable behaviour.
* This change ensures that the `push` command will always push an image regardless of local cache.

## version 0.0.25

### Bugfixes
* Environment variables were not being correctly passed to remote container executions when attaching to an exising container


## version 0.0.24

## Env Command
Added a new command to simplify the export of environment variables. Environment variables can be defined in a blueprint readme, after the blueprint has completed
the varaibles will be presented to the user.

Environment Variables

######################################################

This blueprint exports the following environment varaibles:

KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.shipyard/config/k3s/kubeconfig.yaml=
VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:18200=
VAULT_TOKEN=root=

You can set exported environment variables for your current terminal session using the following command:

eval $(shipyard env)
```

The `env` command will write the defined environment variables to the command line...

```
âžœ shipyard env
export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.shipyard/config/k3s/kubeconfig.yaml
export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:18200
export VAULT_TOKEN=root
```

To set the variable to the command line the user can either copy and paste the output or evaulate it.

```
eval $(shipyard env)
```

## Bugfixes
* Update terminal server in Docs, there was a bug with the latest Chrome where the terminal was not immediately displaying the terminal.

## version 0.0.20

## Clusters
* New feature to persist and share cache for importing images for clusters. Previously each cluster has its own cache which was created every time 
  the cluster was started. Images were copied from the local machine to a Docker volume before being imported to the clsuter. If multiple clusters were
  defined in a config this process would run for each cluster unecessarilly slowed the startup time. Now images are cached in a persistant volume `images.volume.shipyard.run` improving startup times. When a cluster starts it first checks to see if an image exits, if it does not it will import the image from the local Docker instance. 
* Added a new feature to the `purge` command which removes the persistent image cache.

## Modules
* New resource type `modules` which can import other Shipyard configuration blueprints from a file or from GitHub.
* Modules do not respect dependencies, this feature is a TODO item.

```
module "k8s" {
	source = "github.com/shipyard-run/shipyard/examples//single_k3s_cluster"
}

module "consul" {
	source = "../container"
}
```


## version 0.0.19

### Sidecar resource
Added a new resource `sidecar`. A `sidecar` is a special container which shares the network and ip address of the target container.

```ruby
container "consul" {
  image   {
    name = "consul:1.6.1"
  }

  command = ["consul", "agent", "-config-file=/config/consul.hcl"]
}

sidecar "consul" {
  target = "container.consul"

  image   {
    name = "consul:1.6.1"
  }

  command = ["consul", "connect", "envoy", "-sidecar-for", "myservice"]
}
```

### Helm charts
* Added ability to set the namespace

### Purge Command
* Added `shipyard purge` command to remove all cached images, blueprints, and helm charts

### Bugfixes
* Remote exec now correctly pulls a container

## version 0.0.18

### Helm charts
* Added capability to reference a github repo as well as local charts
* Added the ability to specify values as a map addition to a local file

```
helm "vault" {
  cluster = "k8s_cluster.k3s"
  chart = "github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm"

  values_string = {
    "server.dataStorage.size" = "128Mb",
    "server.dev.enabled" = "true",
    "server.standalone.enabled" = "true",
    "server.authDelegator.enabled" = "true"
  }

  health_check {
    timeout = "120s"
    pods = ["app.kubernetes.io/name=vault"]
  } 
}
```

### General
* Added `--force-update` flag to `run` and `get`. The user can specify that any local cache for images and helm charts is ignored at runtime.


## version 0.0.16

### Bugfixes
* By default when looking up the id of a Docker container Docker does a greedy match, this caused issues where we would grab an incorrect id on destroy. Changed to use a regex.

## version 0.0.16

### Bugfixes
* Fixes a bug where local folders were being created for types other than `bind`
* Fix a bug where Volumes for Nomad Clusters were not changed to absolute paths

## version 0.0.15

### General
* When defining a volume mount for a container, if the source does not exist, creat it rather than erroring


## version 0.0.14

### Bugfixes
* Fix bug where Documentation resource was failing to create on OSX. Docker could not read temporary file. 
  Moved temp files to .shipyard folder to avoid conflict.


## version 0.0.11

### Browser windows
Change `OpenInBrowser` to a string so that the user can specify the path

### Version check
Check the latest verison on startup

```
########################################################
                   SHIPYARD UPDATE
########################################################

The current version of shipyard is "0.0.10", you have "841f3b0445cc01f44ea2728dd5113f6b0f611e1f".

To upgrade Shipyard please use your package manager or, 
see the documentation at:
https://shipyard.run/docs/install for other options.
```


## version 0.0.9

### Browser windows
Ensure that browser windows are openened correctly on Windows platforms.

### Preflight
Check that Docker is installed and running


## version 0.0.8

### Bugfixes

* Fix problem with home folder resolution on Windows
* Add ipv6 DNS entries for resources

## version 0.0.7

### Ingress
Add three new ingress types `nomad_ingress`, `k8s_ingress`, `container_ingress`, these new type have cluster specific options
rather than trying to shoehorn all into `ingress`. For now `ingress` exists and is backward compatible.

```
k8s_ingress "consul-http" {
  cluster = "k8s_cluster.k3s"
  service  = "consul-consul-server"

  network {
    name = "network.cloud"
  }

  port {
    local  = 8500
    remote = 8500
    host   = 18500
  }
}

container_ingress "consul-http" {
  target  = "container.consul"

  port {
    local  = 8500
    remote = 8500
    host   = 18500
  }

  network  {
    name = "network.cloud"
  }
}

nomad_ingress "nomad-http" {
  cluster  = "nomad_cluster.dev"
  job = ""
  group = ""
  task = ""

  port {
    local  = 4646
    remote = 4646
    host   = 14646
    open_in_browser = true
  }

  network  {
    name = "network.cloud"
  }
}
```

## Browser Windows
* Added ability to open browser windows to ingress, containers, docs
* Only open browser windows if they have not been opened

## General
* Can now do `shipyard run` or `shipyard run .` and this equals `shipyard run ./`
* Sidebar configuration is now optional in docs
* Changed names of Docker resources and FQDN for resources to `[name].[type].shipyard.run`
* Resources are now resolvable via DNS
* Added interpolation helper `${home()}` to resolve the home folder from config
* Added interpolation helper `${shipyard()}` to resolve the shipyard folder from config

### Bug fixes
* Fix serialisation of blueprint in state
* Fix bug with rolled back resources being in an inconsistent state
* Fix bug with state not serialzing correctly


## version 0.0.6

### Bug fixes
* Fix bug where heirachy in state was lost on incremental applies
* Minor UX tweak for run command, use current directory as default 

## version 0.0.5

### Container
HTTP health checks can now be defined for containers. At present HTTP health checks are executed on the client and 
require forwarded ports or an ingress to be configured. Future updates will move this functionality to the network
removing the requirement for external access.

```javascript
container "vault" {
  image {
    name = "hashicorp/vault-enterprise:1.4.0-rc1_ent"
  }

  command = [
    "vault",
    "server",
    "-dev",
    "-dev-root-token-id=root",
    "-dev-listen-address=0.0.0.0:8200",
  ]

  port {
    local = 8200
    remote = 8200
    host = 8200
  }

  health_check {
    timeout = "30s"
    http = "http://localhost:8200/v1/sys/health"
  }
}
```

### Nomad Job
Nomad job is a new resource type which allows the running of Nomad Jobs on a cluster. Health checks can be applied to jobs
a health check will only be marked as passed when all the tasks in side the job are reported as "Running".

Nomad job is a dependent resource and will not apply until the cluster is up and healthy.

```javascript
nomad_cluster "dev" {
  version = "v0.10.2"

  nodes = 1 // default

  network {
    name = "network.cloud"
  }

  image {
    name = "consul:1.7.1"
  }
}

nomad_job "redis" {
  cluster = "nomad_cluster.dev"

  paths = ["./app_config/example2.nomad"]
  
  health_check {
    timeout = "60s"
    nomad_jobs = ["example_2"]
  }
}
```

## version 0.0.4

### Container
Allow HTTP health checks to be added to containers

## version 0.0.3
This version was skipped due to issues getting Chocolately distributions setup

## version 0.0.2

## Docs
Improve UX with documentation, Shipyard now autogenerates the JSON files required for Docusarus, the user
only needs to author the markdown

## Nomad
Implmeneted ability to push a local container to the Nomad cluster
Allow mounting of custom volumes for Nomad clusters

## Build process
Added Chocolatey and Brew, Deb and Rpm instalation sources

## Yard files
Yard files are to be depricated in favor of Markdown files for blueprints.
The information which was previously added to the .yard file can now be added as frontdown in a `README.md` file which resides in the root of your blueprint.

* Health check for pod was only looking at status not ready checks
* Check Network exists before removing
* Upgrade Helm dependency

## Version 0.0.0-beta.5

### Introduce taint command and the ability to re-create resources.

Resources can now be tainted using the command `shipyard taint [type] [name]`

When a resource is marked as tained the next run of `shipyard run` will destroy the resource and re-create it.
This feature is especailly useful when building blueprints, often you require a change to a particular container you run `shipyard destroy`
to destroy the stack and then `shipyard run` to re-create. Now it is possible to destroy only the affected resource with `shipyard taint`.

### Change behaviour when processing folders

Previously `shipyard run` would recurse into folders, this behaviour causes problems when the sub-folders contain `*.hcl` files which are not
Shipyard resources. `shipyard run` now only process the top level folder. Sub folder support will be added when we add the `module` feature.

### Improve handling for failed resources

Resources which fail to create can now be retired by re-running `shipyard run`, any depended resources which were not created due to the failure
will also be created when the command is run.
